# YouTube Tab Time Counter (Firefox)

## Install (temporary add-on)

1. Open Firefox and visit `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on…**.
3. Select the `manifest.json` file from this folder.
4. Open some YouTube video tabs, then click the extension icon to see totals.

## Notes

- Totals refresh in the background as you open or close YouTube tabs, and you can click **Refresh totals** to force an update.
- The extension reads video durations from open pages, and it can fall back to fetching the video page HTML when a tab is unloaded.
